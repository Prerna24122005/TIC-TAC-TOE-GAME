# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
The game board is a 3x3 grid initialized with spaces.
Players take turns to input their moves (positions 1-9 correspond to grid positions).
After each move, the program checks if a player has won or if the game is a draw.
The game ends when either a player wins or the board is full with no winner (draw).
